# Product Overview

LocalLife AI is a privacy-first, context-aware AI assistant that helps users navigate Indian cities like a local. It provides authentic street-level intelligence about food, slang, traffic, and culture across 35+ Indian cities.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Context-Aware Personas**: Each city has a dedicated 15+ year resident persona with local knowledge
- **Street Food Intelligence**: Real-time recommendations powered by Google Search and Maps grounding
- **Slang Translation**: Deciphers local dialects with social context (usage with elders vs. friends)
- **Voice-First Experience**: Low-latency real-time voice conversations using Gemini Live API
- **Privacy-First**: All chat history and preferences stored exclusively on-device via IndexedDB
- **Visual Postcards**: AI-generated photorealistic images of city landmarks and food

## Intelligence Philosophy

The core approach is **Agent Steering** - injecting custom city contexts that force the AI to:
- Be opinionated rather than generic
- Use regional vocabulary naturally
- Prioritize practical safety (hygiene, social etiquette) over encyclopedic facts
- Provide specific geographical names to trigger Map Grounding

## Four Intelligence Modes

1. **FOOD**: Street food recommendations with specific stalls, timings, and locations
2. **SLANG**: Cultural translation with usage nuances and social context
3. **TRAFFIC**: Local traffic intelligence with bottlenecks, shortcuts, and specific junctions
4. **CULTURE**: Deep dive into city traditions, etiquette, and unwritten rules
